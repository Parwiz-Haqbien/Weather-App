# Weather-App
For my Weather Dashboard I added a basic html and within the html I added a second section which will contain the weather information with the css it is a basic stylin process where there is a text type where users can type a city either press the click button or the enter button in the keyboard to see the weather for that city. I added the @ media so when the screen is in different size the html will react differently. I went to the OpenWeather.com to get the api for the weather and the unique code whihc will used for the api. I added the eventlistener for the click button and with the next set of line code I was checking if the a city is already availbe. I made it so if the user select the same city twice a pop message will appear saying type a different city as you already know the weather for this city. with the api  i got the data of the main ,name,sys and weather. in the next set of line cood is where the weather will display where i created an element "li" and added city. I also added so if the user does not type the a city and press enter or  mistype a popup message will appear stating to type the correct city.
